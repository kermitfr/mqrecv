Custom queue consumer reusing all the mc transport wrappers, with a receiving 
daemon.
Mcollective uses topics, but here we use a queue that makes the system very 
resilient and scalable, suited specifically for handling lots of larger chunks 
of data. 
We use it to send big messages (50k-200k) with some inventory information.
